                                    <h3><a id="what-is-linux">What is Linux?</a></h3>
                                    <p>Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and mobile devices. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux allows us to freely modify and distribute its source code.</p>

                                    <h3><a id="why-linux-is-superior">Why Linux is superior to other systems?</a></h3>
                                    <p class="podpis">Linux is considered superior to other operating systems for several reasons:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><b>Open-source:</b> Anyone can modify and contribute to its development.</li>

                                    </ul>

                                    <h3><a id="socs">SOCs</a></h3>
                                    <p>One of its advantages is its flexibility, especially when configured for use in a Security Operations Center (SOC). Linux allows administrators to customize the operating system by installing only the necessary packages, making it a lean and efficient platform. By carefully selecting and configuring software tools, administrators can create a system that is perfectly suited to the unique needs of a SOC.</p>

                                    <p class="podpis"><b>Network packet capture software</b> is an essential tool for SOC analysts, enabling them to capture and thoroughly examine network transactions. Wireshark is one of the most widely used packet capture tools for network analysis. In addition to packet capture tools, other commonly used tools in SOC environments include:</p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                      <li><b>Malware analysis tools:</b> Used to safely analyze and observe malware behavior without compromising the underlying system.</li>
                                      <li><b>Intrusion detection systems (IDS):</b> These monitor network traffic and alert administrators to suspicious activity in real-time.</li>

                                      <li><b>Ticketing systems:</b> Used for tracking and managing security incidents and task assignments within the SOC.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>Here are some examples of these tools:</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Sguil</h5>

                                    <h3><a id="importance-of-configuration-text-files">The importance of configuration text files</a></h3>
                                    <p class="podpis">Linux stores configuration settings in plain-text files. These files allow us to customize the behavior of the system, services, and applications. Common examples of configuration files include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>/etc/fstab:</b> Defines how disk drives and partitions are mounted.</li>
                                        <li><b>/etc/passwd:</b> Contains user account information.</li>
                                        <li><b>/etc/ssh/sshd_config:</b> Configuration for the SSH server.</li>
                                        <li><b>/etc/network/interfaces:</b> Defines network interface configurations.</li>
                                        <li><b>/etc/hosts:</b> Maps hostnames to IP addresses, allowing for local hostname resolution.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Text-based configuration files make Linux flexible, as they can be easily edited, version-controlled, and scripted for automation tasks.</p>

                                    <h3><a id="server-services-and-most-used-ports">Server services and most used ports</a></h3>
                                    <p>A <b>port</b> in computer networking refers to a logical endpoint for communication in a network. It is a 16-bit number (ranging from 0 to 65535) used by the Transport Layer protocols, such as TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol), to distinguish different services or applications running on a device. Ports allow multiple applications or services to run on the same machine without interfering with each other by assigning unique numbers for each service.</p>

                                    <p class="podpis">Here are key points about ports:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Well-known Ports:</b> Ports 0-1023 are typically reserved for system or widely used services (e.g., HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443).</li>
                                        <li><b>Registered Ports:</b> Ports 1024-49151 are used by applications that are not as widely standardized as well-known ports but are still registered for specific services.</li>
                                        <li><b>Dynamic or Private Ports:</b> Ports 49152-65535 are used for temporary connections by client applications and are often assigned dynamically by the operating system.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>Ports play a crucial role in network communication, ensuring that data is routed to the correct service or application on a device. Linux is widely used for hosting server applications. Some of the most common server services and their associated ports include:</p>

                                    <p>A port scanner is a tool used to check which ports are open on a given server or network device. Commonly used port scanners include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><b>Nmap:</b> A powerful and widely used network scanning tool that can detect open ports, services, and vulnerabilities.</li>
                                    <li><b>Netcat:</b> A simple tool for reading and writing data across network connections using TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) or UDP (User Datagram Protocol).</li>
                                    <li><b>Telnet:</b> A simple command-line tool for testing connectivity to remote servers over specific ports.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>By using a port scanner like Nmap, network administrators can check the security and configuration of their systems, identify open ports, and detect unauthorized services.</p>

                                    <h3><a id="linux-distributions">Linux distributions</a></h3>

                                    <p>Linux distributions refer to the various flavors of Linux operating systems that are packaged with different sets of software, tools, and configurations to meet specific needs. Popular Linux distributions like Ubuntu, CentOS, and Debian are commonly used in SOCs. Security-focused distributions like Kali Linux and Security Onion are tailored for penetration testing and security monitoring. Each distribution has its own package management system, software repositories, and intended use cases, making it essential to choose the right one based on the specific requirements of the SOC or organization. Raspbian is a Debian Linux derivative used in the Raspberry Pi boards.</p>

                                    <h3><a id="virtual-machines">Virtual Machines</a></h3>
                                    <p>Virtual machines (VMs) provide a convenient way to run Linux on a Windows machine without needing to dual-boot or modify the underlying hardware. By using software like VMware or VirtualBox, we can create a virtualized environment to install and run a Linux distribution alongside our existing Windows operating system. This allows developers, administrators, and security analysts to test, configure, or run Linux tools within a controlled and isolated environment. It is an efficient solution for running Linux-specific applications or conducting security analysis, all while keeping the host Windows system intact.</p>

                                        <li><b>cron:</b> Manages scheduled tasks and automates repetitive jobs.</li>
                                        <li><b>sshd:</b> Handles incoming SSH connections for secure remote access.</li>
                                        <li><b>httpd:</b> Powers web servers, such as Apache or Nginx.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    <p>Daemons usually have names ending in <b>d</b>, indicating their function as a service process. They enhance Linux's multitasking capabilities by enabling smooth background operations and service management without user intervention.</p>

                                    <h3><a id="ssh">SSH: Secure Remote Access</a></h3>
                                    <p><b>Secure Shell (SSH)</b> is a protocol that allows us to securely access and manage remote systems over an encrypted connection. SSH is an essential tool for system administrators and SOC analysts, enabling secure communication with servers, transferring files, and executing commands remotely. SSH provides robust authentication methods, including password-based and key-based authentication, ensuring safe access to sensitive systems.</p>
                                    <p>The SSH service on Linux is managed by the <b>sshd</b> daemon, which listens for incoming SSH connections on port 22 by default. Administrators can configure SSH by editing the <b>/etc/ssh/sshd_config</b> file, where options such as allowed authentication methods, permitted IPs, and port numbers can be customized to enhance security.</p>
                                    <p>SSH is not only vital for routine server management but also serves as a secure foundation for tools like secure file transfer (SCP) and remote command execution, making it indispensable in Linux environments.</p>

                                    <p>A <b>hard link</b> in Linux is a reference to an inode (the data structure that stores the file's information) on the file system. Hard links allow multiple directory entries to refer to the same inode. Essentially, a hard link is just another name for an existing file.</p>

                                    <p>One of the main characteristics of hard links is that they are indistinguishable from the original file. Deleting one hard link does not affect the others, and the data is only removed from the disk when the last hard link is deleted.</p>

                                    <h5>Key points</h5>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Hard links cannot span across different file systems.</li>
                                        <li>Hard links cannot be created for directories (except for '.' and '..').</li>
                                        <li>They share the same inode number, meaning they point to the same data blocks on the disk.</li>
                                        <li>When a hard link is deleted, the data is not actually removed until all links pointing to the inode are deleted.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h5>Creating a hard link</h5>
                                    <p>To create a hard link, the <code>ln</code> command is used, followed by the source file and the new link name: <code>ln /path/to/original/file /path/to/hardlink</code></p>

                                    <p>In this example, <code>/path/to/original/file</code> is the source file, and <code>/path/to/hardlink</code> is the new hard link.</p>

                                    <h5>Checking hard links</h5>
                                    <p>We can check how many hard links exist for a file using the <code>ls -l</code> command. The second column shows the number of hard links to a file: <code>ls -l /path/to/file</code></p>
                                    <p>The number displayed in the second column indicates how many links point to the inode, including the original file and any hard links created.</p>
                                    <p>In summary, hard links provide an efficient way to create multiple references to the same file, allowing us to have several access points to the data without duplicating the content.</p>

                                    <p><b>Forking</b> is a key concept in Linux, where a running process creates a new process by duplicating itself. The new process is called the child process, and it gets its own unique Process ID (<b>PID</b>). This is typically used in multitasking systems, where the operating system enables the concurrent execution of multiple processes. Forking allows a parent process to create child processes, which can run independently or cooperate with the parent.</p>
