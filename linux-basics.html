                                    <h2>What is Linux?</h2>
                                    <p>Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system. It is widely used for servers, desktops, and mobile devices. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux allows us to freely modify and distribute its source code.</p>

                                    <h2>Why Linux is superior over other systems</h2>
                                    <p class="podpis">Linux is considered superior to other operating systems for several reasons:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><b>Open-source:</b> Anyone can modify and contribute to its development.</li>

                                    <li><b>Customizability:</b> We can customize nearly every aspect of the system, from the kernel to the user interface.</li>
                                    <li><b>Performance:</b> Linux runs efficiently even on older hardware, providing faster performance compared to many other OSes.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>SOCs</h2>
                                    <p>One of its advantages is its flexibility, especially when configured for use in a Security Operations Center (SOC). Linux allows administrators to customize the operating system by installing only the necessary packages, making it a lean and efficient platform. By carefully selecting and configuring software tools, administrators can create a system that is perfectly suited to the unique needs of a SOC.</p>

                                    <p class="podpis"><b>Network packet capture software</b> is an essential tool for SOC analysts, enabling them to capture and thoroughly examine network transactions. Wireshark is one of the most widely used packet capture tools for network analysis. In addition to packet capture tools, other commonly used tools in SOC environments include:</p>
                                    
                                    <ul>
                                      <li><b>Malware analysis tools:</b> Used to safely analyze and observe malware behavior without compromising the underlying system.</li>
                                      <li><b>Intrusion detection systems (IDS):</b> These monitor network traffic and alert administrators to suspicious activity in real-time.</li>
                                      <li><b>Firewalls:</b> Used to control traffic flow into and out of a network, protecting it from unauthorized access.</li>

                                      <li><b>Ticketing systems:</b> Used for tracking and managing security incidents and task assignments within the SOC.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                    
                                    <p>Here are some examples of these tools:</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Sguil</h5>
                                    <p>Sguil is an open-source security console that provides real-time access to intrusion detection system (IDS) alerts. It is often used in combination with other tools in Security Onion, a specialized Linux distribution, to help analysts manage and investigate security events.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Bro/Zeek</h5>
                                    <p>Zeek (formerly known as Bro) is a powerful network monitoring platform that captures and analyzes network traffic. It is commonly used in SOC environments for real-time traffic analysis and alert generation based on traffic patterns.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Snort</h5>
                                    <p>Snort is a widely used network intrusion detection system (NIDS) that logs network packets and analyzes traffic in real-time. It uses signature-based detection to identify potential threats and is commonly deployed in SOCs to detect early signs of intrusion.</p>
                                    
                                    <h5>Elastic Stack (ELK)</h5>
                                    <p>The Elastic Stack (consisting of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) is a set of tools often used in SOCs for searching, analyzing, and visualizing large volumes of log data. The Elastic Stack helps analysts quickly access and process data, which is crucial for effective incident response.</p>
                                    

                                    <h2>Nano and other editors</h2>
                                    <p>In Linux, text editors are essential for editing configuration files, writing scripts, and more. Some popular text editors include:</p>
                                    <ul>

                                    <p>Linux stores configuration settings in plain-text files. These files allow us to customize the behavior of the system, services, and applications. Common examples of configuration files include:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                    <li><b>/etc/fstab:</b> Defines how disk drives and partitions are mounted.</li>
                                    <li><b>/etc/passwd:</b> Contains user account information.</li>
                                    <li><b>/etc/ssh/sshd_config:</b> Configuration for the SSH server.</li>
                                    <li><b>/etc/network/interfaces:</b> Defines network interface configurations.</li>

                                    <p>Virtual machines (VMs) provide a convenient way to run Linux on a Windows machine without needing to dual-boot or modify the underlying hardware. By using software like VMware or VirtualBox, we can create a virtualized environment to install and run a Linux distribution alongside their existing Windows operating system. This allows developers, administrators, and security analysts to test, configure, or run Linux tools within a controlled and isolated environment. It is an efficient solution for running Linux-specific applications or conducting security analysis, all while keeping the host Windows system intact.</p>
