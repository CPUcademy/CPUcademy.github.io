                                    <p>Bandwidth refers to the maximum theoretical capacity of a network link to transmit data, often expressed in bits per second (bps). It represents the upper limit of data transfer speed that a network can handle. Throughput, on the other hand, is the actual rate at which data is successfully transmitted over the network. While bandwidth is the potential capacity, throughput reflects real-world performance, which can be influenced by factors such as network congestion, signal interference, and protocol overhead. Therefore, while a network may have high bandwidth, its throughput may be lower due to these limiting factors.</p>

                                    <h2>Intermediary VS end devices</h2>

                                    <p>End devices are the final recipients or senders of data in a network. These devices, such as smartphones, computers, and printers, interact directly with users or applications. Intermediary devices, on the other hand, help route, manage, or secure data as it travels through the network. These include routers, switches, firewalls, and gateways, which ensure that data is correctly directed and securely transmitted between end devices. While end devices facilitate user interaction, intermediary devices ensure data reaches its destination efficiently and securely.</p>

                                    <h2>Cellular VS Wi-Fi</h2>

                                    <p>Cellular and Wi-Fi are two different methods for providing wireless internet connectivity. Cellular networks use mobile towers and base stations to provide internet access over long distances, often through data plans provided by telecom companies. Cellular networks support mobility and allow devices to stay connected while moving. Wi-Fi, on the other hand, is a short-range wireless network typically set up in homes, offices, and public places using routers and access points. It provides high-speed internet within a local area but requires the device to be within the coverage area of a Wi-Fi access point. While cellular is more mobile, Wi-Fi tends to offer higher speeds and lower latency in stationary setups.</p>

                                    <h2>Localhost VS 127.0.0.1</h2>

                                    <p>Both localhost and 127.0.0.1 refer to the loopback address used for testing network services on the local machine. The key difference lies in their resolution: localhost is a hostname that resolves to the loopback address (typically 127.0.0.1) via the system's DNS or hosts file, while 127.0.0.1 is the numeric IP address directly associated with the loopback interface. Though functionally similar, localhost depends on correct hostname resolution, whereas 127.0.0.1 directly bypasses this, making it more reliable in certain misconfigured environments.</p>

                                    <h2>The OSI model</h2>

                                    <p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement networking protocols in seven layers. Each layer has a distinct function and interacts with the layers above and below it, ensuring standardization in communication across diverse systems.</p>

                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Layer 7: Application Layer</b> - The topmost layer that provides user interfaces and directly interacts with software applications. Examples include HTTP (web browsing), SMTP (email), and FTP (file transfer).</li>
                                        <li><b>Layer 6: Presentation Layer</b> - Handles data translation, encryption, and compression, ensuring data is in a readable format for the application layer. Examples include JPEG (image formatting) and SSL/TLS (encryption).</li>
                                        <li><b>Layer 5: Session Layer</b> - Manages sessions between applications by establishing, maintaining, and terminating communication sessions. Protocols include NetBIOS and PPTP.</li>
                                        <li><b>Layer 4: Transport Layer</b> - Ensures reliable data transfer, error recovery, and flow control between devices. Key protocols are TCP (reliable) and UDP (fast but unreliable).</li>
                                        <li><b>Layer 3: Network Layer</b> - Determines how data packets are routed between devices using logical addressing (e.g., IP addresses). Key protocols include IPv4, IPv6, and ICMP.</li>
                                        <li><b>Layer 2: Data Link Layer</b> - Facilitates node-to-node data transfer and handles physical addressing (MAC addresses) and error detection. Technologies include Ethernet, PPP, and Wi-Fi (MAC layer).</li>
                                        <li><b>Layer 1: Physical Layer</b> - The foundation of the model, defining the physical medium, hardware, and signals for data transmission. Examples include twisted-pair cables, fiber optics, and radio frequencies.</li>
                                    </ul>
                
                                    <p>The OSI model standardizes networking protocols, simplifies troubleshooting, and enhances interoperability across diverse hardware and software systems. Modern networks use protocols from the OSI model, such as TCP/IP, which correspond to specific layers, ensuring efficient communication and data exchange.</p>

                                    <h2>The access layer</h2>

                                    <p>The access layer is the foundational layer in a hierarchical network design, responsible for connecting end devices such as computers, printers, and IoT devices to the network. It provides wired and wireless connectivity using technologies like Ethernet cables and Wi-Fi while managing traffic through features like VLANs (Virtual LANs) to enhance performance and security. This layer enforces access control mechanisms, such as authentication protocols (e.g., 802.1X) and access control lists (ACLs), to ensure secure and controlled network access. Common devices in the access layer include switches, which facilitate device connectivity and support features like QoS (Quality of Service), and wireless access points (APs) that provide cable-free connectivity for mobile and stationary devices. The access layer plays a crucial role in delivering secure, efficient, and reliable network access, forming the backbone of user connectivity in modern network designs.</p>
