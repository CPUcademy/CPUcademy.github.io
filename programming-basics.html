                                    <h2>Low-level VS high-level programming languages</h2>
                                    <p class="podpis">Programming languages can be categorized into low-level and high-level languages based on their abstraction from machine instructions:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Low-level languages:</b> These are closer to the hardware and include C++. They offer high performance and control over system resources but require more effort to write and debug.</li>
                                        <li><b>High-level languages:</b> These are closer to human language and include Python and Java. They are easier to write, read, and maintain but are less efficient compared to low-level languages as they rely on interpreters or compilers to convert code into machine instructions.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                    <h2>Compiled VS interpreted languages</h2>
                                    <p class="podpis">Programming languages can be classified based on how their code is executed:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Compiled languages:</b> These languages, like C++ and Java, require a compiler to convert the source code into machine code before execution. The compilation process improves performance but adds an additional step.</li>
                                        <li><b>Interpreted languages:</b> These languages, like Python and JavaScript, are executed line-by-line by an interpreter. They are easier to debug and run but can be slower than compiled languages.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                    <h2>Types of programming paradigms</h2>
                                    <p class="podpis">Programming paradigms define different approaches to problem-solving in programming:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Procedural programming:</b> Focuses on a sequence of instructions and uses functions to break down tasks.</li>
                                        <li><b>Functional programming:</b> Treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state or mutable data.</li>
                                        <li><b>Object-oriented programming:</b> Models real-world entities as objects that encapsulate data and behavior.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                
                                    <h2>Alphabet VS syntax VS semantics VS lexis</h2>
                                    <p class="podpis">These concepts are fundamental to understanding how programming languages are structured:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Alphabet:</b> The set of valid characters or symbols in a language, such as letters, digits, and operators.</li>
                                        <li><b>Syntax:</b> The rules that define the correct structure and format of statements in a language.</li>
                                        <li><b>Semantics:</b> The meaning behind syntactically correct statements or expressions.</li>
                                        <li><b>Lexis:</b> The vocabulary of a language, including keywords and identifiers.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>Absolute VS relative file paths</h2>
                                    <p class="podpis">When working with files in programming, paths can be specified in two ways:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><b>Absolute path:</b> This specifies the full path from the root directory to the target file. For example, <code>C:\Users\John\Documents\file.txt</code> (Windows) or <code>/home/john/documents/file.txt</code> (Linux).</li>
                                        <li><b>Relative path:</b> This specifies the path relative to the current working directory. For example, <code>files/document.txt</code> refers to a file located in a folder named <code>files</code> within the current directory.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>Time</h2>

                                    <p>In Unix systems, a timestamp represents the number of seconds that have passed since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 (UTC). This starting point, known as the Unix epoch, marks the beginning of time measurement for Unix-based systems. The Unix epoch was selected as a practical and arbitrary reference. By using a continuous count of seconds, it streamlines time calculations and eliminates the challenges posed by calendar irregularities, such as leap years or months with varying numbers of days.</p>

                                    <h2>EOF (End-Of-Line)</h2>

                                    <p class="podpis">EOF is a character or sequence of characters that marks the end of a line of text. Different systems use different end-of-line characters:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><code>LF</code> - UNIX/Linux</li>
                                        <li><code>CR+LF</code> - Windows</li>
                                        <li><code>CR</code> - Mac OS</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <h2>Important terms</h2>

                                    <ul>
