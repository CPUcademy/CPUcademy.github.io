It simplifies reality by creating a version of an object that consists only of essential information. Data is visible only to semantically related functions to prevent misuse. Example: We can do many things on a computer, but it doesn't show us how it's doing them because we don't need that information. The implementation parts are hidden.

It involves hiding the fields and methods of a class so that they are not accessible from the outside but only inside the class. The difference between abstraction and encapsulation is that abstraction hides objects and processes to show only the result at the end because it is the only thing that matters, while encapsulation hides them and blocks access to them, e.g., because some data should not be changed directly without a setter with validation rules inside. It is the second concept of object-oriented programming.</td>

The class that is being inherited from is called a parent class (also a base class or a superclass). The class that inherits from another class is called a child class (also a derived class or a subclass). It is the third concept of object-oriented programming.</td>

Example: A man can be a father, a husband, a student, etc. One person can have different roles.</td>

We call class methods using the class directly without creating its instance (<code>Example.classMethod()</code>).

We can call static methods using the class directly without creating its instance (like class methods). They take neither a <code>self</code> nor a <code>cls</code> argument, which makes them essentially ordinary functions within the class. They have no access to the class's objects. Static methods differ from outside functions because we can override them later in a child class.</td>

It can't call out its own objects, so we can only use them in its child classes. It also can't have instances. An abstract method is a method that is in an abstract class and has the <code>@abstractmethod</code> decorator in front of it. We create abstract classes by inheriting the <code>ABC</code> object from the imported module. These classes provide a base for subclasses to extend and implement abstract methods and are used as a blueprint for other classes. An abstract class forces all its child classes to override all its abstract methods.</td>
