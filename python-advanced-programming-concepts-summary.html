It simplifies reality by creating a version of an object that consists only of essential information. Data is visible only to semantically related functions to prevent misuse. Example: We can do many things on a computer, but it doesn't show us how it's doing them because we don't need that information. The implementation parts are hidden. It is the first concept of object-oriented programming.</td>

It involves hiding the fields and methods of a class so that they are not accessible from the outside but only inside the class. The difference between abstraction and encapsulation is that abstraction hides objects and processes to show only the result at the end because it is the only thing that matters, while encapsulation hides them and blocks access to them, e.g., because some data should not be changed directly without a setter with validation rules inside. Encapsulation also promotes the creation of small, specialized methods and classes to keep them easy to understand, maintain, and reuse. It is the second concept of object-oriented programming. We should always identify the part of the code that changes and, when possible, encapsulate it.</td>

The class that is being inherited from is called a parent class (also a base class or a superclass). The class that inherits from another class is called a child class (also a derived class or a subclass). It is the third concept of object-oriented programming.</td>

For example, the + operator behaves polymorphically because it can add numbers and concatenate strings (it works with various data types in a very similar way). It is the fourth concept of object-oriented programming. Example: A man can be a father, a husband, a student, etc. One person can have different roles.</td>

A variable of this type will still exist even if an instance of the class does not. It is shared by all objects and not tied to any class instance (shared across all instances of the class). We create static variables outside methods. A static variable is also called a <b>class attribute</b>.</td>

We call class methods using the class directly without creating its instance (<code>Example.classMethod()</code>).

We can call static methods using the class directly without creating its instance (like class methods). They take neither a <code>self</code> nor a <code>cls</code> argument, which makes them essentially ordinary functions within the class. They have no access to the class's objects. Static methods differ from outside functions because we can override them later in a child class.</td>

                                          <td>An abstract class is a class that is designed specifically to be used as a base class (e.g., creating an instance of a generic <code>Vehicle</code> wouldn’t make sense unless it’s a specific type like a <code>Car</code> or <code>Truck</code>). It can't call out its own objects or have instances, so we can only use them in its child classes. An abstract class provides an API that we are expected to implement in its child classes (acting as a blueprint for the functionality). An abstract method is a method that is inside an abstract class and has the <code>@abstractmethod</code> decorator in front of it. We create abstract classes by inheriting the <code>ABC</code> object from the imported module. These classes provide a base for subclasses to extend and implement abstract methods and are used as a blueprint for other classes. An abstract class forces all its child classes to override all its abstract methods. It isn't mandatory to override a non-abstract method from an abstract class. Non-abstract methods can contain implementations to be inherited in the child classes (abstract methods have to be overridden, so it wouldn't make sense for them to contain implementations). If an abstract class contains a constructor, it will be executed when its subclass is instantiated.</td>

Delete the school, and the students will still exist. Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independently of the parent (e.g., wheels are a part of a car).</td>
